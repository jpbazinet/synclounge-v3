## jpbazinet Customizations

This fork includes the following additions on top of the base [synclounge](https://github.com/chrisae9/synclounge):

- **IMDb button** — Appears in the toolbar next to the Invite button when in a room. Grey/disabled when nothing is playing; active when a show or movie is playing, linking directly to the IMDb page for the current title. The IMDb ID is pulled automatically from Plex metadata.
- **Chat emojis** — The chat panel now supports emojis either through the emoji picker, or typed :).
- **Chat images** — You can also cut and paste images directly into chat.
- **Chat URLs** — Links shared in chat are clickable.

SyncLounge is a tool to sync [Plex](https://plex.tv) content across multiple players in multiple locations. Watch movies and TV shows together with friends and family, no matter where they are.

This is a continuation of the original [SyncLounge](https://github.com/synclounge/synclounge) project, modernized with Vue 3, Vuetify 3, and Vite.

## What's Different

This fork has been substantially reworked from the original:

- **Vue 3 + Vuetify 3 + Vite** — Migrated from Vue 2/Vuetify 2/Webpack
- **Built-in web player only** — External Plex client control has been removed (it no longer works reliably with modern Plex)
- **Chromecast support** — Cast content to Chromecast devices ($5 Google Cast developer registration required)
- **Discord/social previews** — Share links generate rich OpenGraph embeds with poster images and metadata
- **MKV direct play** — Properly handles MKV containers that Plex repackages as MP4
- **Subtitle fixes** — Fixed libjass subtitle rendering in Vite's ESM strict mode
- **Mobile-friendly** — Responsive layout improvements for small screens
- **Library browsing** — Sort, filter, and A-Z index for library content; lazy loading with skeleton placeholders
- **Server management** — Enable/disable servers with visibility toggles; all servers searchable by default

## How It Works

SyncLounge keeps multiple viewing sessions in sync using a WebSocket server as a relay between clients. Users join a room, and the host controls playback — play, pause, seek, and content changes are synced to everyone in the room. If the host plays something new, SyncLounge searches each user's available Plex servers for a matching copy.

## Features

- Synchronized playback across the internet
- Built-in web player optimized for sync accuracy
- Chromecast casting support
- Autoplay — automatically finds matching content across your Plex servers
- Library browsing with sorting, filtering, and A-Z quick navigation
- Search across all connected Plex servers
- Chat with room members
- Optional Plex user and server authorization allowlists
- Shareable invite links with rich social previews
- Installable desktop and mobile web app with an offline connection screen
- Configurable sync flexibility and sync method (clean seek / skip ahead)

## Watch-party controls and troubleshooting

New rooms open on library browsing. On phones, library navigation shows a back action and the current location. Media rows support touch scrolling; desktop users can also use the arrows. Invite copies the room link. Settings → Advanced contains the optional watch-party service selector, separate from Plex library selection.

The watch-party drawer starts in Basic mode. Advanced controls reveal synchronization settings and participant diagnostics; the message composer stays available in landscape and while typing.

The host can choose Strict (0.5 seconds), Balanced (3 seconds), or Relaxed (7 seconds) room synchronization, or use each viewer’s personal tolerance. Relaxed synchronization reduces corrective seeks; it cannot repair a slow stream. Participant details show playback state, drift, and recent buffer/quality measurements. After repeated substantial buffering, Settings can offer a lower-quality option for that viewer; applying it may require Plex transcoding.

Settings → Notifications can hide buffering popups without disabling playback diagnostics. Menu → Report a problem copies a bounded report for sharing with the host, without requiring GitHub. Include what happened and the report’s timestamp; Plex/transcode session identifiers connect it to server logs. Raw error messages, credentials, and chat are excluded. GitHub issue creation is optional and requires pasting the report into the issue.

Picture-in-picture remains available when the browser supports it. Installed iOS web apps may have platform limitations; SyncLounge does not force picture-in-picture when leaving the app.

## Running

### Docker

```sh
docker run -p 8088:8088 ghcr.io/chrisae9/synclounge:latest
```

### Docker Compose

```yaml
services:
  synclounge:
    image: ghcr.io/chrisae9/synclounge:latest
    ports:
      - 8088:8088
    restart: unless-stopped
```

Development builds are published separately as `ghcr.io/chrisae9/synclounge:dev`. Every development build also has an immutable `dev-<commit SHA>` tag. These images may be unstable and never replace `latest`.

### Node.js

```sh
SKIP_BUILD=true npm ci
npm run build
node server.js
```

Listens on port 8088 by default. The documented deployment serves SyncLounge at the root of a hostname; path-prefix deployments require additional asset-base configuration and are not currently supported by the published image.

## Install as an app

Serve SyncLounge over HTTPS (or localhost for testing), then choose **Install SyncLounge**
in the navigation menu. On iPhone and iPad, use the browser’s **Share → Add to Home Screen**
option. Installation uses the root of the hostname, matching the supported deployment layout.

Watching and chatting require a connection. The offline screen caches only public assets;
room pages, credentials, posters, and video are never cached by the service worker.
When an update is ready, choose **Update available → Reload now** between viewing sessions.
Updates do not automatically reload an active player.

## Configuration

Configuration can be set via environment variables matching the keys in [`config/defaults.js`](config/defaults.js). Nested objects and arrays are passed as JSON strings:

```sh
AUTHENTICATION='{"mechanism":"plex","type":["server"],"authorized":["MACHINE_ID"]}'
SERVERS='[{"name":"My Server","location":"Mothership","url":"https://myserver.com"}]'
```

`AUTHENTICATION` is enforced on socket connections using the signed-in user's Plex
account or accessible server IDs. Invalid restrictions fail startup; rejected or unavailable
Plex verification denies the connection. Restricted deployments must serve the web app and
socket endpoint from the same origin: the browser sends its Plex credential only to its
own origin. Unrestricted deployments keep `mechanism: "none"`.

Host recovery uses a server-issued reconnect proof stored per browser tab. Reloading that
tab preserves its identity; clearing session storage starts a new identity. Temporary
connection loss, including a heartbeat timeout, automatically reconnects the tab and
rejoins its room. Leaving a room cancels pending recovery.

Rooms clear when their last participant leaves; playback is not saved for an empty
room. Reopening an old movie invite without active playback returns to the library
with an explanation so you can choose a movie again.

Set the server option `ROOM_STATE_PATH=/data/private/room-state.json` on a persistent volume to
preserve reconnect proofs and room ownership across server restarts. The process must be
able to create or own that private directory; it must not be group- or world-writable. The file contains private signing material; do not serve it
as static content or share it between concurrently running servers. Without this option,
restarting the server resets reconnect identities and room ownership.

After a restart, a remembered host has 60 seconds to rejoin with its existing tab proof;
a host that was playing must restore media before reclaiming control. Explicit host
transfers override recovery. Inactive ownership records expire after 24 hours. Enabling
persistence for the first time cannot recover proofs from an earlier server instance.

Only documented browser configuration is returned from `/config.json`; arbitrary keys in a
configuration file remain server-side. `TRUST_PROXY` controls which reverse proxies may supply
client addresses. It defaults to `loopback`, matching the Nginx example below. For a proxy on a
private container network, prefer an explicit hop count or the proxy's exact CIDR. A named range
such as `uniquelocal` is safe only when the application is directly reachable by that reverse
proxy; other clients on the trusted network could otherwise spoof `X-Forwarded-For` and bypass
per-IP limits. Do not use `TRUST_PROXY=true`. Set `PUBLIC_ORIGIN` to the externally reachable
HTTP(S) origin (for example, `https://synclounge.example.com`) to enable absolute poster URLs in
Open Graph previews. Incoming `Host` headers are never used to construct those URLs.

Shared previews come from the current room host's validated socket updates. Browse links
show media details only when they match that room's current media; other links use the
generic preview. The legacy `/api/metadata` writer and `/share/poster` relay return HTTP 410.
Poster snapshots use unguessable revision URLs and remain available for up to six hours
after a media change so link-preview caches can finish fetching them.

## Reverse Proxy (Nginx)

Socket admission defaults to 512 clients overall, 32 clients per IP, 32 pending Plex
authentication requests, and 60 connection attempts per IP per minute. Override with
`SOCKET_MAX_CONNECTIONS`, `SOCKET_MAX_PER_IP`, `SOCKET_MAX_PENDING_AUTH`, and
`SOCKET_ATTEMPTS_PER_MINUTE` (positive integers). Transport-only TCP clients are capped
at twice `SOCKET_MAX_CONNECTIONS`. Set `TRUST_PROXY` correctly so a reverse proxy does
not make all users share one IP allowance. Limits apply separately to each server process.

```nginx
map $http_upgrade $connection_upgrade {
    default upgrade;
    ''      '';
}

server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    server_name synclounge.example.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8088;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_socket_keepalive on;
        proxy_redirect off;

        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Host $server_name;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection $connection_upgrade;
    }
}
```

## Development

```sh
SKIP_BUILD=true npm ci
npm run serve   # Vite dev server with HMR
npm run build   # Production build to dist/
npm test        # Run tests
```

Pull requests target `dev`; `main` is reserved for stable release promotions. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the complete verification and review contract.

## Chromecast

Chromecast support requires a [Google Cast developer registration](https://cast.google.com/publish/) ($5 one-time fee) and a published receiver app. The receiver app ID is configured in the SyncLounge settings.
