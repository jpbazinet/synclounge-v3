# SyncLounge Release

Run this workflow from the SyncLounge repository root. Preserve the repository's
two-lane branch model: changes merge into `dev`, then `dev` is promoted to
`main`. Release tags must point to commits on `main`.

## Prepare

1. Confirm the repository and working tree before making changes:

   ```sh
   test "$(git config --get remote.origin.url | sed 's/\.git$//')" = "https://github.com/chrisae9/synclounge" \
     || test "$(git config --get remote.origin.url | sed 's/\.git$//')" = "git@github.com:chrisae9/synclounge"
   git status --short --branch
   gh auth status
   git fetch origin --prune --tags
   ```

   Stop if the working tree is not clean or the repository identity is wrong.

2. Inspect the release delta:

   ```sh
   LAST_TAG=$(git tag --merged origin/main --sort=-v:refname | head -1)
   if [ -n "$LAST_TAG" ]; then
     git log --oneline "$LAST_TAG"..origin/dev
     git diff --stat "$LAST_TAG"..origin/dev
   else
     EMPTY_TREE=$(git hash-object -t tree /dev/null)
     git log --oneline origin/dev
     git diff --stat "$EMPTY_TREE" origin/dev
   fi
   ```

   Read the relevant diffs and merged pull requests; do not rely only on commit
   subjects.

3. Select the next SemVer version. Use `v1.0.0` if no release tags exist;
   otherwise choose a patch, minor, or major bump based on user-visible impact.
   Confirm that neither the Git tag nor GHCR version already exists.

## Land the version bump

1. Create a focused branch from the latest `origin/dev`:

   ```sh
   git switch --create release/v<VERSION> origin/dev
   npm version <VERSION> --no-git-tag-version
   ```

   If `origin/main` is not an ancestor of this branch, merge it into the release
   branch and resolve conflicts while preserving the reviewed release delta.
   Verify the resulting application diff before continuing. Land that PR with
   a merge commit so the reconciliation ancestry reaches `dev`.

   `<VERSION>` excludes the `v` prefix. Verify that `package.json` and the root
   lockfile agree.

2. Run the repository's required checks:

   ```sh
   SKIP_BUILD=true npm ci
   npm run lint -- --no-fix
   npm run build
   npm test
   npm run audit
   docker build --build-arg VERSION=<VERSION> -t synclounge:<VERSION> .
   ```

3. Commit the version files, push the branch, and open a pull request targeting
   `dev`. Include the exact verification results in the pull request. Wait for
   required checks and CodeRabbit, then resolve every actionable finding before
   merging.

4. Promote `dev` to `main` with a separate pull request whose head is the
   repository's `dev` branch. Do not push directly to `main`. Wait for required
   checks and merge the promotion with a merge commit before tagging. Do not
   squash or rebase promotions: removing their shared ancestry causes recurring
   conflicts in later releases. Keep merge commits enabled and linear-history
   enforcement disabled on both release lanes while retaining CI and review rules.

## Write release notes

Review every commit and pull request from the previous release tag through the
promoted commit. Omit empty sections and use this format:

```markdown
## SyncLounge <VERSION>

### Changes
* **Category/Area** — Describe the change in present tense and include useful technical detail.

### Fixes
* **Category/Area** — Explain the symptom and how it was fixed.

### Maintenance
* **Category/Area** — Summarize dependency, CI, cleanup, or release work.
```

- Use `*`, a bold category, and an em dash for every bullet.
- Use specific categories such as **Player**, **WebSocket**, **Docker**,
  **CI/CD**, **Server/Security**, or **Release**.
- Put code references in backticks.
- Link relevant pull requests and commits.
- Keep each bullet concise and factual.
- Do not mention AI tools, agents, or automated review processes.

Present the complete release notes to the user before creating or pushing a
tag. Tag only after explicit approval unless the user already authorized
unattended release tagging in the same request.

## Tag and publish

1. Refresh and verify the exact release commit:

   ```sh
   git fetch origin --prune --tags
   git switch --detach origin/main
   VERSION=$(node -p "require('./package.json').version")
   test "$(node -p "require('./package-lock.json').version")" = "$VERSION"
   test "$(git tag -l "v$VERSION")" = ""
   git merge-base --is-ancestor HEAD origin/main
   ```

2. Create an annotated tag containing the approved release notes, then push
   only that tag:

   ```sh
   APPROVED_NOTES_FILE=/path/to/approved-release-notes.md
   test -s "$APPROVED_NOTES_FILE"
   git tag -a "v$VERSION" --cleanup=verbatim -F "$APPROVED_NOTES_FILE"
   git push origin "v$VERSION"
   ```

   `--cleanup=verbatim` preserves Markdown headings. Git's default tag-message
   cleanup treats lines beginning with `#` as comments and removes them.

3. Monitor the tag-triggered release workflow:

   ```sh
   set -eu
   command -v jq >/dev/null
   APPROVED_NOTES_FILE=/path/to/approved-release-notes.md
   test -s "$APPROVED_NOTES_FILE"
   RELEASE_COMMIT=$(git rev-parse "v$VERSION^{commit}")
   RUN_ID=""
   for _ in $(seq 1 60); do
     RUN_ID=$(gh run list --repo chrisae9/synclounge \
       --workflow release.yml --event push --commit "$RELEASE_COMMIT" --limit 1 \
       --json databaseId --jq '.[0].databaseId')
     [ -n "$RUN_ID" ] && break
     sleep 5
   done
   if [ -z "$RUN_ID" ]; then
     echo "Release workflow run not visible after 5 minutes: https://github.com/chrisae9/synclounge/actions/workflows/release.yml" >&2
     exit 1
   fi
   gh run watch "$RUN_ID" --repo chrisae9/synclounge --exit-status

   PREV_TAG=$(git tag --sort=-v:refname | grep -A1 "^v$VERSION$" | tail -1)
   if [ "$PREV_TAG" != "v$VERSION" ] && [ -n "$PREV_TAG" ]; then
     CHANGELOG_LINK="**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/chrisae9/synclounge/compare/$PREV_TAG...v$VERSION"
   else
     CHANGELOG_LINK="**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/chrisae9/synclounge/commits/v$VERSION"
   fi
   EXPECTED_BODY=$(printf '%s\n\n%s' \
     "$(cat "$APPROVED_NOTES_FILE")" "$CHANGELOG_LINK")
   RELEASE_JSON=$(gh release view "v$VERSION" --repo chrisae9/synclounge \
     --json body,isDraft)
   test "$(printf '%s' "$RELEASE_JSON" | jq -r '.isDraft')" = "false"
   test "$(printf '%s' "$RELEASE_JSON" | jq -r '.body')" = "$EXPECTED_BODY"

   VERSION_IMAGE=$(docker buildx imagetools inspect \
     --format '{{json .}}' "ghcr.io/chrisae9/synclounge:$VERSION")
   VERSION_DIGEST=$(printf '%s' "$VERSION_IMAGE" | jq -er '.manifest.digest')
   for IMAGE_TAG in latest "$VERSION" "${VERSION%.*}" "${VERSION%%.*}"; do
     IMAGE=$(docker buildx imagetools inspect --format '{{json .}}' \
       "ghcr.io/chrisae9/synclounge:$IMAGE_TAG")
     test "$(printf '%s' "$IMAGE" | jq -er '.manifest.digest')" = "$VERSION_DIGEST"
     printf '%s' "$IMAGE" | jq -e \
       '.manifest.manifests | any(.platform.os == "linux" and .platform.architecture == "amd64")' >/dev/null
     printf '%s' "$IMAGE" | jq -e \
       '.manifest.manifests | any(.platform.os == "linux" and .platform.architecture == "arm64")' >/dev/null
     for PLATFORM in linux/amd64 linux/arm64; do
       REVISION=$(printf '%s' "$IMAGE" | jq -er --arg platform "$PLATFORM" \
         '.image[$platform].config.Labels["org.opencontainers.image.revision"]')
       test "$REVISION" = "$RELEASE_COMMIT"
     done
   done
   ```

   Stop if the exact commit's workflow does not succeed or does not appear by
   the stated deadline. Verify that the published, non-draft GitHub Release body
   exactly matches the approved notes plus its changelog link. The `latest`,
   `x.y.z`, `x.y`, and `x` GHCR tags must share one digest, point to the release
   commit, and each include `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`.

If publishing is still running, report the workflow URL and current status. If
any check fails, stop and report the exact failure; do not move or recreate the
tag without explicit approval.
